<h2> Header</h2>
<p> Note, header tags are based on hierarchy not the look of the size. Typically your h1 will match your title. Keep it consistent.</p> <p> You should never skip header tag numbers e.g., go from h1 to h4. There are instances where ou will break this rule occasionally, but know why you do it. </p> Header tags go from h1-h6. IT is rare that you wil use h5 or h6. <p>
<div id = "Paragraphs"> 
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p> This is a paragraph tag. Paragraphs will make up the bulk of your text. <p> Semantically, you should put any intformational text that isnt of top level organizational in a p tag</p>

<h3> Here is how they work: </h3> 
</div>
<p> A paragraph is a block level element. Block level elements start on a new line and take up an entire line. </p>
<div i="pretag">
<h2> Pre Tag </h2>
<p> You can use the pre tag to make text that matches the spaces and indentions you input into your text editor.</p>
<!-- The pre element is the only one that will let me match my text with the spacing that I have in my code document -->
<pre> I a           m 
    breaking up       all
      of this   text
